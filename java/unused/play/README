This was an attempt to build the API using Play 1.2.4. Play is awesome
for web apps and looks like a fun way to build APIs that meet its 
patterns. Sadly, you can't handle arbitrary content (like a WADL file)
in Play 1.2.4 that I could see. It looks like Play 2.0 is different but
you have to learn Scala to use all the features, so for now I am
abandoning Play.
