h1. Maven support

This module lets you manage your dependencies with "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/

h3. Getting Started

first you need to download and install "apache maven":http://maven.apache.org/download.html

finally, you need to install the play-maven module  

bc. play install maven


h3. Activate module 

h4. *NOTE: due to this reported bug: "commands.py loading breaks if more than one module":https://bugs.launchpad.net/play/+bug/560852 , this module does not work together with ivy module, or maybe other modules.*

for existing projects, you can add the following line to your conf/application.conf:

bc. module.maven=${play.path}/modules/maven

if you start from scratch, you can create an ivy project with *play new myapp --with maven* command, which will active the module and execute play mvn:init.


h3. play-maven specific commands 

bc. play mvn:init

installs play-parent project (a Maven pom project) into local Maven repository. Then creates the appropriate *pom.xml*. After this step, you can add your dependencies to pom.xml 

bc. play mvn:update // or play mvn:up

retrieves all defined dependencies and then it copies them into your app/lib folder

bc. play mvn:refresh // or play mvn:re

clears your app/lib folder first, then it executes play mvn:up 

bc. play mvn:source // or play mvn:src

retrieves all sources (if available) of defined dependencies and then it copies them into app/lib folder
